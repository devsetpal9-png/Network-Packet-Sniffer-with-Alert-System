# Data Directory

This directory contains all data files generated by the Network Packet Sniffer.

## Auto-generated Files
- `network_traffic.db` - SQLite database with packet records and alerts
- `network_sniffer.log` - Application log file
- `traffic_report.png` - Generated traffic visualization reports

## Sample Data (for testing)
- `sample_packets.csv` - Example packet data for demonstration
- `sample_alerts.json` - Example alert data for testing

## Git Ignore
Actual data files are excluded from Git via `.gitignore` to prevent committing sensitive network data.
